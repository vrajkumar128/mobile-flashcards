## How to Run Locally

<ol>
  <li>Ensure you have the Expo Go app installed on your phone.
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent">Google Play</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779">App Store</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Install Expo on your computer with <code>npm install -g expo</code>.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository with <code>git clone https://github.com/vrajkumar128/mobile-flashcards.git</code>.</li>
  <li><code>cd</code> into the cloned directory and run <code>npm install</code> to download the necessary packages.</li>
  <li>Run <code>npx expo start</code> to start the app; if your phone is connected to the same network as your computer, you should see the app appear in Expo Go on your phone.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, you can use an Android emulator like <a href="https://www.genymotion.com/">Genymotion</a> or <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> to run the app in Expo Go (this still requires downloading Expo Go from Google Play on the emulated device).</li>
</ol>
